# Coffee Machine Interface

This project was done asn an assignment to display coding skills. It uses:
- Typescript
- Next.js
- React.js
- Styled Components
- Redux Toolkit
- RTK Query

There was a time constrain, so some functionalities aren't optimised.

Here is what I prioritised and covered on this project:
âœ… Correct set-up of Next.js + Styled Components (observing SGI, using SWRCR) + Redux toolkit (observing the SSR functionalities) + RTK Query
âœ… Proper set-up of theme, Provider, and color schemes
âœ… Attention to some design detail such as "Large" coffee icons on "size" are bigger than "venti" for example
âœ… Solid implementation of RTK Query
âœ… Implementation of a 'organiseData' function, to transform the data into a better, more readable structure and avoid Tech Debt accumulation
âœ… Solid implementation of Redux, which saves the user order in a Global State.
âœ… Proper separation of server-side components to handle the API and client components to handle effects and react hooks
âœ… Redux slices and store well-organised
âœ… App Router from Next.js
âœ… Font Family changed into the Font-Family closest to the one on Figma, but free.
âœ… Overall folder structure following best practices (components, lib, types, api etc)
âœ… Each component does one - and only one - clear, well-defined thing as much as possible
Code written in the most human-friendly way possible, nice and clean.

Here is what I did not have time to finish / areas for improvement:
ðŸ“ˆ Design details such as exact margins on titles, etc
ðŸ“ˆ Best practices on images/svg URLs (in real case scenarios, those image URLs should come from CMS or back end)
ðŸ“ˆ Folder structure could be improved - maybe set up a folder like "pages" where we could put all pages in and connect the Next Router there instead of the top level on "app"
ðŸ“ˆ Extract all types from components to the types folder
ðŸ“ˆ Add Redux-Persist in case user refreshes the page they won't use the order 
ðŸ“ˆ If we wanted to make this app air-tight and fail-proof, we would still need to do a few things:
  - Create a 404 / Something went wrong page
  - Create a "no connection" page
  - Add dafety mechanisms in case, for example, the data from the back end is changed.
  - Add automated tests that can notify the teams if any API changes breaks the front end app
  - Add more mechanisms that the app can still be operational even if a change is done from the API
ðŸ“ˆ UI Improvements:
  - Add a "Clear Order" button
  - Change text on final screen from "Review your order" to "Brew your coffee"
  - Add animations and a darker background color when the user clicks the button for feedback
